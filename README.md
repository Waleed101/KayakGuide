# Vibr-eye (formally Paligate):
Code and other data for our first-year design project

## Second Iteration
The second part, which was geared towards the first-year design project. The main solution was aimed towards aiding the visually impaired in more easily kayaking, a service that local charity Abilities in Motion adminsters to the public. It used a Raspberry Pi to collect real time vision data, and track the moving kayaks in the group. This data is then communicated to the on-vest Arduino Uno, which features a wireless data transmitter and an array of vibration motors that provide the wearer with haptic feedback.

## First Iteration
The first part consistented of creating a PoC, which involved an array of vibration motors and ultrasonic sensors operating in tandem to provide the visually impaired with an idea of their surrondings. This was submitted, and recieved second place at the Western Engineering Competition.
